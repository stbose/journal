-------------------

This is an attempt to build an easily maintainable 
and portable research journal.  Entries in the notebook 
are written in markdown (I use pandoc's extended markdown) 
and a python script autogenerates an index.

Requirements
--------------------
     -- make
     -- python 
     -- pandoc (or other md interpreter) 

Built this on Mac 10.9.  Brew install ghc and used 
cabal to get pandoc.
